# Pandemic Memorial

PandemicMemorial.com is a website dedicated to honoring those whose lives were lost in the fight against COVID-19.

Check it out at http://pandemicmemorial.com/.

In an effort to deliver quickly, a simple `index.html` page will be deployed and updated until a MERN/MEAN application can be developed.
